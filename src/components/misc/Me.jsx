                    <h3>For many people, it’s a dream to live in a center of innovation, where the tiresome old becomes displaced by an exciting new. Growing up in Seattle, I was always surrounded by this spirit. My dad worked as a software engineer for Amazon in its heyday, then Yahoo!, and finally the University of Washington. My mom was a data analyst for the federal government. On the way to school, I would often pass by the Microsoft or T-Mobile headquarters sprawled under the cloudy sky. Tech dominated my life. </h3>

     <h3>Yet, the new age of technology hides a competitive undercurrent, especially for students. As humans, we first become susceptible to social influence when we reach adolescence (Imogen). For many of my peers and I, being surrounded by overwhelming amounts of success meant an enormous pressure to excel. As a result, while we would watch films glamorizing a traditional adolescence full of social and personal exploration, we lived in a reality that was dominated by academic pressure. Entering high school, I noticed that for many of my peers, learning had become more about competition–earning the highest homework and test scores–than genuine curiosity, something I that sadly still observe in college. This unhealthy competition has generally led to many consequences, sometimes severe.

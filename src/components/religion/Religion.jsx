                        <h3>As we were preparing to leave, we stopped by a small, sunbeat church. It was called the Església de Sant Pere (St. Peter’s church) and was the first religious monument we had seen in the town. Given the historical prevalence of Christianity in Spain, the presence of a church in Pals was hardly a surprise. It was an affirmation that religion was engrained within the daily lives of Pals’ citizens.</h3>

                        <h3>Indeed, in most of Medieval Europe the lives of people revolved around church. It was standard to attend church three to five times daily for prayer and service (Mark). Religion was particularly significant in Spain because of its Muslim, Jewish, and Christian populations. Consequently, religion not only influenced lifestyle in Spain, but also sparked frequent violence. Indeed, in Girona, a large town just twenty minutes away, Jewish-Christian violence was extremely common (Smith 1). Pals likely saw similar clashes. </h3>

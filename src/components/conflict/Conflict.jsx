                        <h3>After leaving the town square, we walked east for several minutes, passing by the thousand-year old Torre de les Hores on the way to an overlook with views of the surrounding countryside and the Mediterranean Sea two miles away (Medieval Villages: Pals). As we stopped for a photo, I noticed that we were in fact standing on what looked like an old wall. At first, I ignored it; however, after several seconds of thought, I grew confused. What did Pals need a wall to defend against? After all, Catalonia is not known for a volatile history.</h3>

                        <h3>The wall we saw was indeed a defensive wall. During the back half of the Middle Ages, towns along Europe’s southern coast were threatened by raids from Barbary pirates from Northern Africa (Davis 87). Hundreds of thousands of Europeans are estimated to have been captured from these raids to be sold as slaves in the Mediterranean slave trade. Indeed, numerous reports and public broadsheets told stories of Christians taken by the thousands to toil to their deaths in Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, or Tripoli, underscoring the fear that led Pal’s citizens to build a wall (Davis 89). Many other Spanish cities, such as Valencia, built similar fortifications, but most were demolished to make space for growing populations over the centuries (Garcia 88). </h3>

As we stopped for a photo, I noticed that we were in fact standing on what looked like an old wall. At first, I ignored it; however, after several seconds of thought, I grew confused. What did Pals need a wall to defend against? After all, Catalonia is not known for a volatile history.</h3>

                        <h3>The wall we saw was indeed a defensive wall. During the back half of the Middle Ages, towns along Europe’s southern coast were threatened by raids from Barbary pirates from Northern Africa (Davis 87). Hundreds of thousands of Europeans are estimated to have been captured from these raids to be sold as slaves in the Mediterranean slave trade. Indeed, numerous reports and public broadsheets told stories of Christians taken by the thousands to toil to their deaths in Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, or Tripoli (Davis 89). While the scale of the slave trade is still disputed, the diffusion of violent tales of Barbary pirates underscores the fear that led Pals’ citizens to build a wall. </h3>

                        <h3>When we arrived at Pals, we began walking up a winding pathway to the old town square. Buildings that were hundreds of years old stood empty to our sides, with branches of dead trees crawling up their walls. Without the bustle of visiting crowds, it was natural to wonder what life had been like for Palâ€™s citizens as we walked. What would people have done on this narrow cobblestone street eight hundred years ago? </h3>

                        <h3>One of the most important features of Pals would have been its market, for which Pals received a charter in 1293 (Medieval Villages: Pals). A market charter, which could only be granted by the King and was difficult to receive, would have transformed the town. Indeed, trade was flourishing in the 13th century in the region of Catalonia, where Pals is located. After the collapse of the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate left the local textile industry in ruins, local rulers began importing enormous amounts of cloths from France (Hernando 5). Pals, situated on the coast just south of France, would have stood in the middle of many trade routes, benefitting the town greatly. On market days, the streets of Pals would have been bustling with merchants and locals. </h3>

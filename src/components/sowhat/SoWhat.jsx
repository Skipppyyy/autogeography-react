                    <h3>&emsp;&emsp;Pals might be described as “mundane” or “unimpressive” compared to the places that surround it. Yet, this trait has been Pals’ greatest strength. When Barcelona was bombed during the Spanish Civil War, Pals was left alone. As Spain became an increasingly popular tourist destination in the late 1900s, Pals was disregarded. Consequently, Pals has been able to preserve the genuine memory of its inhabitants remarkably well, in turn preserving their mark on the world. Pals may fall short of excellence as defined by the number of people who visit the town, but Pals' value comes from something less quantifiable–it’s an honest, historic reminder that being normal is okay. In a world where the past is viewed as a burden and excellence is the goal, Pals normalcy makes it special. </h3>

                    <h3>&emsp;&emsp;In tech, there is a rapidly rising emphasis on working for only the biggest and best companies, placing companies like Microsoft and Apple on high pedestals. In computer science, we tailor our resumes and opportunities to this goal, turning our focus away from personal passions. There is truth behind the stereotype that college students in STEM are more interested in the money than the major. We neglect our own curiosity in fear of being a “normal” person in a “normal” company. This is a deep flaw in a field where progress is driven by creativity and innovation. We must reembrace a culture of curiosity. That might mean accepting normalcy for the time-being, but today that’s what makes a person unique. </h3>

                    <h3>&emsp;&emsp;Pals is mundane and unimpressive compared to the places that surround it. In other words, it falls short of excellence. Yet, this trait has been Palsâ€™ greatest strength. When Barcelona was bombed during the Spanish Civil War, Pals was left alone. As Spain became an increasingly popular tourist destination in the late 1900s, Pals was disregarded. Consequently, Pals has been able to preserve the genuine memory of its inhabitants remarkably well, in turn preserving their mark on the world. In a world where the past is viewed as a burden and excellence is becoming the goal, Pals is an honest, historic reminder that being normal is okay.</h3>
